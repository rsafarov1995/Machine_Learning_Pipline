# Machine_Learning_Pipline
Machine Learning Workflow Although the exact implementation details can vary, the general structure of a machine learning project stays relatively constant:  Data cleaning and formatting Exploratory data analysis Feature engineering and selection Establish a baseline and compare several machine learning models on a performance metric Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model to optimize it for the problem Evaluate the best model on the testing set Interpret the model results to the extent possible Draw conclusions and write a well-documented report
